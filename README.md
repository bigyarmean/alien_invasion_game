Alien Invasion Game
Project Overview
This project is my implementation of the "Alien Invasion" game, inspired by the project outlined in "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes. It's a space-themed shooter game where the player controls a ship that must defend Earth from waves of descending aliens.
Key Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I've gained practical experience in:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Implemented classes for game elements like the ship, aliens, and bullets.
Game Development with Pygame: Used Pygame to handle game graphics, events, and animations.
Event Handling: Managed keyboard and mouse inputs to control the player's ship.
Collision Detection: Implemented logic to detect collisions between game objects.
Game States: Created different states for game start, play, and game over scenarios.
Performance Optimization: Managed game elements efficiently to maintain smooth gameplay.
File I/O: Implemented a high score system that persists between game sessions.
Version Control: Used Git for tracking changes and managing project development.

Skills Demonstrated

Python programming
Game logic implementation
Graphics rendering
User interface design
Problem-solving and debugging

This project showcases my ability to create a complete, interactive application while applying various programming concepts and best practices.
